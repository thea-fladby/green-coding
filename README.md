# Green Coding: Bridging Computing Education and Environmental Sustainability to Increase Sense of Belonging

## Introduction

Welcome to the Green Coding project! This initiative is the result of Thea Karin Fladby's Master's thesis in Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Spring 2024. My mission is to enhance the sense of belonging for women in computing education by demonstrating the impactful union between technology and environmental sustainability.

## Motivation

Research indicates that illustrating the societal benefits of computing education, particularly in areas like environmental sustainability, significantly boosts women's engagement and persistence in computing fields. This project aims to tap into this potential by creating an informative platform where the synergy between computing and environmental initiatives is highlighted.
